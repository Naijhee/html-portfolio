 <h2>Top 3 Movies According To Me</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>I love this movie for it's symbolism. How the human mind and the belief in oneself is more powerful than anything. Also the best action scenes ever.</p>
 <h3>The Tuxedo</h3>
 <p>Jackie Chan is the greatest, one of my favorite celebrities of all time, This movie is vintage Jackie Chan and I'm very nostalgic for it. Plus James Brown is in it, win win.</p>
 <h3>Napoleon Dynamite</h3>
 <p>Another nostalgic movie for me. The comedy is right up my alley and I often find myself recalling it's scenes with a smile.</p>
